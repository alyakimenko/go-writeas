## Documentation

See all functionality and usages in the [API documentation](https://developers.write.as/docs/api/).

### Example usage

```go
import "github.com/writeas/go-writeas/v2"

func main() {
	// Create the client
	c := writeas.NewClient()

	// Publish a post
	p, err := c.CreatePost(&writeas.PostParams{
		Title:   "Title!",
		Content: "This is a post.",
		Font:    "sans",
	})
	if err != nil {
		// Perhaps show err.Error()
	}

	// Save token for later, since it won't ever be returned again
	token := p.Token

	// Update a published post
	p, err = c.UpdatePost(p.ID, token, &writeas.PostParams{
		Content: "Now it's been updated!",
	})
	if err != nil {
		// handle
	}

	// Get a published post
	p, err = c.GetPost(p.ID)
	if err != nil {

	}

	// Delete a post
	err = c.DeletePost(p.ID, token)
}
